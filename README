# Kitt Peak NSO Vacuum Telescope code
## Introduction
This repository contains codes used in my final year MMath project.

## How to use the IDL codes
Clone the repository and add the `src` directory to the IDL path. The `tools/` directory contains `update_idl_path` to automate this for the current shell. This should work for most shells. IDL sessions then called will be able to access functions and procedures in `src`.

You can do this with

```console
	git clone https://github.com/celestyal/kitt-peak-nvst
  cd kitt-peak-nvst
	. tools/update_idl_path
```

**NOTE:** By default, `update_idl_path` assumes you are using `gdl`. To change this, manually edit the `IDL_CMD` variable at the start of the script.

## Example codes
Currently, an example script `mmath_project.pro` is contained in `examples/`. This is part of my final year MMath project.

## Acknowledgment
NSO/Kitt Peak data used here are produced cooperatively by NSF/NOAO, NASA/GSFC, and NOAA/SEL.
